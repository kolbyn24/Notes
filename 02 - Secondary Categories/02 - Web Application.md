### Web Application
An in-depth web application assessment will be performed against specifically stated assessment target component(s).

- [ ] Enumeration
                - [Basic Enumeration](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web)
                - Manual webpage crawling. Make sure you are proxying traffic through burp
                - gowitness
                - Directory enumeration with dirb or similar tools [[ffuf]]
				                -`feroxbuster --url https://example.com --thorough -o fb_main-1.txt`
				                - To run it authenticated, add something like this to include the session cookies and avoid hitting any logout endpoints(will skip anythig in wordlist that matches pattern): `-H 'Cookie: session=eyJ0...' --dont-scan 'logout'`
				                - By default, it uses `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt`, but you can specify whatever wordlist you want with `-w`
                - [vhost enumeration](https://sidxparab.gitbook.io/subdomain-enumeration-guide/active-enumeration/vhost-probing)
				                -`gobuster vhost -u http://url/ -t 50 -w subdomains.txt`
				                -`gobuster vhost -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u stocker.htb -t 50 --append-domain`
				                -Add sub domain to your hosts files after finding a vhosts
				-Sub domain enumeration
								- `gobuster dns -d mysite.com -t 50 -w subdomains.txt`
								- Other methods here [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/external-recon-methodology)
                - Look for logins, admin pages, hidden pages, etc.

				                - iframe injection can be used for lfi: `<iframe src=/etc/passwd height=500 width=500></iframe>` or `<iframe src=file:///var/www/dev/index.js height=1000px width=1000px></iframe>`

                - Can you enumerate usernames? What is the lockout policy?
