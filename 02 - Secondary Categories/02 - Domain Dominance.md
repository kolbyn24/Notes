### Domain Dominance
The term "domain dominance" is used to describe a state where an attacker has reached a high level of privilege in a domain (such as Domain or Enterprise Admins) and collected credential material or placed backdoors that 1) allows them to maintain that level of access almost indefinitely; and 2) makes it practically impossible that the domain or forest can ever be considered "clean" beyond reasonable doubt.


You should only carry these out in controlled conditions with the expressed permission of the client.
