### Learning Log

- Stanford CS230 | Autumn 2025 | Lecture 1: Introduction to Deep Learning - 1 hour - 10/23/2025 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NLHFoVNlbg

## ✅ How to Turn It Into CISSP CPEs

(ISC)² explicitly allows **self-study** and **educational videos** as CPE-eligible activities.

Here’s what to do:

1. **Keep a learning log**
    
    - Note each lecture title, date watched, duration, and short summary (1–2 sentences).
        
    - Example:  
        _“CS230 Lecture 1: Intro to Deep Learning – Covered perceptrons, loss functions, and SGD. 1.5 hrs.”_
        
2. **Log it as self-study (Group A)**
    
    - Category: _Education / Self-Study_
        
    - Credits: 1 CPE = 1 hour (so a 90-min lecture = 1.5 CPEs).
        
    - Domain: _Security Architecture & Engineering_ (or “Emerging Tech / AI Risk” if you want to justify context).
        
3. **Keep proof**
    
    - Screenshot each lecture’s YouTube title and timestamp.
        
    - Keep your notes in one doc or PDF in case ISC² audits you.
        
4. **Submit**
    
    - Go to your ISC² member portal → _“Submit CPEs”_ → choose Group A → enter course title (“Stanford CS230 – Deep Learning Lecture 1”), provider (“Stanford University”), date, hours, short summary, and attach your screenshot/log.
