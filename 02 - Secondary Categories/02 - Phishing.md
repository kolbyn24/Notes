### Phishing
Gain foothold into the client network through a phishing email sent with a malicious payload.
- [ ] Buying a domain [namecheap](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/domains/domaincontrolpanel/dc-gov.com/domain)
                - After purchase of domain, go to domain list, click manage on your domain, and set your nameserver to custom DNS. I had 5 nameservers and set them to ns1.linode.com to ns5.linode.com.
                - Make sure to buy a domain as soon as possible, newly registered domains are typically flagged.
- [ ] Creating a publicly available Linode server
                - Create a new Linode server [linode](https://cloud.linode.com/linodes). 
                - Click create Linode and go to [clone](https://cloud.linode.com/linodes/create?type=Clone%20Linode). Clone an exiting server and choose the cheapest plan.
                - under the network section, set the reverse DNS to the domain that you purchased (it is the localhost by default).
                - In the firewall section, modify the firewall to allow port 22, 80, 443.
                - In the domains section, create a new domain for the domain name that was purchased.  Add NS records (Name Sever is ns1.linode.com-ns5.linode.com, subdomain is dc-gov.com for all. There should be 5 lines. )
                - Add A/AAA record. Hostname is purchased domain name and IP Address is your public IP address. 
                - Access the server and setup SSH. Add your public ssh key to known-host file.

                - dmarc. Under domains section in linode, add a TXT record. Hostname is `_dmarc`  and value is `v=DMARC1; p=none`
                - dkim. [main walkthrough](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-dkim-with-postfix-on-debian-wheezy). Once that is setup, add a TXT record with the hostname `main._domainkey` and the value of `v=DKIM1; h=sha256; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBg...` the value of p comes from `cat mail.txt`. You have to append the second line of the p parameter to the end of the first line and add that to your txt record.
                - spf. Add a TXT record. Hostname is blank, value is `v=spf1 mx a ip4:ip.ip.ip.ip ?all` I.E. `v=spf1 mx a ip4:66.228.36.51 ?all`
                - [Test your email configuration](https://www.mail-tester.com/) you can send emails using `echo "This is the body of the email" | mail -s "This is the subject line" test-iimosa79z@srv1.mail-tester.com` or by sending emails through gophish
                - You can test if your IP address or domain name is blacklisted [here](https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx)
- [ ] GoPhish campaign configuration
                - Create email template - Make sure to edit through the HTML section. you can use `{{.url}}` to include a link to your landing page.
                - Create landing page - You can try using the import site feature through gophish but a much better way is using the "save page WE" chrome or firefox extension. This will copy a page to a local .html file. Cat out the file and paste it into gophish. use this [link](https://docs.getgophish.com/user-guide/faq) to troubleshoot form submission not capturing data. 
                - set up sending profile - host field should be `localhost:25`. Add a custom header with the header "X-Mailer" and the value to a single whitespace. This will remove the X-Mailer: gophish" header.
                - Set up user and group - you can bulk upload by having a .csv file in Firstname,lastname,email,title format. I would also create a test group.
                - Set up campaign - url field should be `https://yourdomain/`. WARNING: if you do not set a launch date and you submit this section it will start sending out emails.
                - To create a static webpage, `mkdir /opt/gophish/static/endpoint` then `echo "test" > index.html`, and then visit https://HOSTNAME/static/index.html
