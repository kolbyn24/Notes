# [[DNS Enumeration]]  
___

## Description:  

The goal of DNS enumeration is to take a top level domain and find either sub-domains or records containing CNAMES that point to either interesting servers or domains that can be taken over (DNS name that can be purchased or sub-domain takeover with some sort of cloud environment)

### Tools:

cert.sh - website that checks DNS records
wayback urls - local tool that uses the wayback machine to find old records based on a domain name
brute_subs.sh - Patrick Higgins wrote this script to automate subdomain brute forcing
owasp amass - github page that uses other techniques to find subdomains

------

### Process:
Set the top level domain (bash):
```
export DOMAIN=example.com
```
Use crt.sh
```
#This command will give you the raw HTML respnse
curl "https://crt.sh/?q=$DOMAIN" -o "${DOMAIN}_crt_sh.txt"
#This command will sort the HTML and give you a clean list of sub domains
grep '<TD>' "${DOMAIN}_crt_sh.txt" | grep -Po "[^>]+$DOMAIN" | sort -u > "${DOMAIN}_crt_sh_sorted.txt"
```
You can attempt to resolve these either by opening them in firefox or using eyewitness.
```
# Check the number of lines, be careful opening large files in firefox
wc -l "${DOMAIN}_crt_sh_sorted.txt"
# Open in Firefox
cat "${DOMAIN}_crt_sh_sorted.txt" | xargs firefox
# Take screenshots with eyewitness
./EyeWitness -f "${DOMAIN}_crt_sh_sorted.txt" --web
```

Install wayback URLs
```
$ go install github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls@latest
$ sudo ln -s ~/go/bin/waybackurls /usr/local/bin/
```
Use it with the following:
```
export DOMAIN=example.com
echo "$DOMAIN" | waybackurls | tee "$DOMAIN_waybackurls.txt"

# You can bulk run it with the following:
cat domains.txt | while read dn; do echo "##### $dn #####"; echo "$dn" | waybackurls | tee "${dn}_waybackurls.txt"; echo; done

# Once you have the output you can sort it with
ls *_waybackurls.txt | while read f; do export dn=$(echo "$f" | sed 's/_waybackurls.txt//'); echo "##### $dn #####"; grep -Po "^.+?$dn" "$f" | sed -r 's/^http.?:\/\///' | sort -u | tee -a "${dn}_potential_subs.txt"; echo; done
```

To run amass and do a brute force to enumerate subdomains you can use this script that Patrick Higgins wrote:
usage: `amass_and_brute_subs.sh domain subdomain_file.txt`
seeÂ best-dns-wordlist.txtÂ from https://wordlists.assetnote.io/ for a good word list.

```
#!/bin/bash
#
# amass_and_brute_subs.sh
#
# Create lists of potential subdomains from a list of parent domains.
# Uses OWASP amass and a given wordlist
#
# Note: For a good subdomain wordlist, see best-dns-wordlist.txt from https://wordlists.assetnote.io/
#

domains_file="$1"
wordlist="$2"
if [[ ! -r "$domains_file" || ! -r "$wordlist" ]]; then
    echo 'Usage:' >&2
    echo "    $0 <domains_file> <wordlist>" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# check for amass in PATH
if [[ -z $(which amass) ]]; then
    echo 'amass not found in PATH' >&2
    exit 2
fi

# begin main loop
for domain in $(cat "$domains_file"); do
    echo "$domain ..."

    # try not to clobber output file
    output_file="$domain"_potential_subs.txt
    if [[ -f "$output_file" ]]; then
        printf "Output file $output_file already exists. Overwrite? (Y/n) "
        read choice
        if [[ "$choice" == 'n' || "$choice" == 'N' ]]; then
            echo 'Exiting'
            exit 3
        fi
    fi

    # run amass, append output to file
    amass enum -silent -passive -timeout 2 -d "$domain" -o "$output_file"

    # cycle through wordlist, append potential subs to file
    for sub in $(cat "$wordlist"); do
        echo "${sub}.${domain}" >> "$output_file"
    done

    # add root domain to file as well for further resolution tools
    echo "$domain" >> "$output_file"

    # remove duplicates
    sort --unique --output="$output_file" "$output_file"

done

echo 'Completed. Output files stored in format: DOMAIN_potential_subs.txt'


```
