# [[Forged Certificates]]  
___

## Description:  

In larger organisations, the AD CS roles are installed on separate servers and not on the domain controllers themselves. Â Often times, they are also not treated with the same sensitivity as DCs. Â So whereas only EAs and DAs can access/manage DCs, "lower level" roles such as server admins can often access the CAs.

So although this can be also seen a privilege escalation, it's just as useful as a domain persistence method.

Gaining local admin access to a CA allows an attacker to extract the CA private key, which can be used to sign a forged certificate (think of this like the krbtgt hash being able to sign a forged TGT). Â The default validity period for a CA private key is 5 years, but this can obviously be set to any value during setup, sometimes as high as 10+ years.
