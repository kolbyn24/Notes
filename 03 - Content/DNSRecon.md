# [[DNSRecon]]  
___

## Description:
DNSRecon can be used early on in an internal engagement to identify nameservers/domain controllers and potentially obtain a list of DNS A records if zone transfers are unrestricted.


## Commands
Locate a domain's nameservers/domain controllers
```
dnsrecon -d domain.local
```

Attempt zone transfers
```
dnsrecon -d domain.local -a
```

You can usually find the FQDN of the network you're connected to by running `ipconfig` from Windows or by checking `/etc/resolv.conf` from Linux
