## Setup 
### Internal
```bash

# For internal, make sure firewall on share allows connections from your IPs
ufw allow from a.b.c.d/24

# Or if fed lead is ok with it...
ufw disable
```

### External
```bash
# For external, there is no share setup required. However, if the share is not showing up, try the following:
# For windows, just mount \\samba0.env9\share

sudo mount -a
```
