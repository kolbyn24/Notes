    <h1>Oops! You Clicked on a Simulated Phishing Test</h1>
    <p>Don‚Äôt worry, this was part of a phishing awareness training exercise. Our goal is to help you recognize phishing emails before they pose a threat to our organization.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p><span class="alert">Here‚Äôs what you should have noticed:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Suspicious Sender:</strong> The email came from <span class="link">accounts@ssmxtech.com</span>, which looks close to a legitimate domain but is off by just one or two letters. Always verify the sender‚Äôs domain carefully.</li>
            <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> The subject line and body suggest urgent action, ‚Äú<em>[Action Required] Please Sync Your SMX Account</em>.‚Äù Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency to prompt you to act without thinking.</li>
            <li><strong>Unfamiliar Link:</strong> The link in the email, <span class="link">https://smxtech.com/stafford</span>, leads to an external site. Before clicking, hover over the link to verify the domain. In this case, it could be easy to mistake it for a legitimate site.</li>
            <li><strong>Grammar and Spelling Errors:</strong> Phrases like ‚ÄúThank you for the understanding!‚Äù contain subtle but noticeable mistakes that can be signs of phishing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tips">
        <h2>How to Protect Yourself from Phishing</h2>
        <p>To avoid falling victim to phishing attacks, remember to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify the sender‚Äôs email address, especially if the email contains an urgent request.</li>
            <li>Hover over links before clicking to ensure they lead to a trusted and secure website.</li>
            <li>Look for grammar or spelling mistakes, which are common in phishing emails.</li>
            <li>When in doubt, contact the help desk or your supervisor before clicking on any suspicious link.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>If you ever have concerns about an email, please reach out to the IT security team immediately!</p>
