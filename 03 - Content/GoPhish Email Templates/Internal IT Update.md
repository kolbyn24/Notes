All, <br><br>
Several new security patches were released by Microsoft and we've incrementally applied the changes to our mailboxes and email system this week. <b>You <i>MUST</i> login <a href="{{.URL}}">here</a> before EOD tomorrow (XX/XX/XX)</b> to confirm that access to your mailbox has not been affected.

<br><br>
If you experience any issues, please respond to this email.

Thanks,
