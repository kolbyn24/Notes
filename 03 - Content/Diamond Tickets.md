# [[Diamond Tickets]]  
___

## Description:  
Like a golden ticket, a diamond ticket is a TGT which can be used to access any service as any user. Â A golden ticket is forged completely offline, encrypted with the krbtgt hash of that domain, and then passed into a logon session for use. Â Because domain controllers don't track TGTs it (or they) have legitimately issued, they will happily accept TGTs that are encrypted with its own krbtgt hash.

A diamond ticket is made by modifying the fields of a legitimate TGT that was issued by a DC. Â This is achieved by requesting a TGT, decrypting it with the domain's krbtgt hash, modifying the desired fields of the ticket, then re-encrypting it.


Diamond tickets can be created with Rubeus.

```
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Debug\Rubeus.exe diamond /tgtdeleg /ticketuser:nlamb /ticketuserid:1112 /groups:512 /krbkey:390b2f[...snip...]91a8aa /nowrap
```

Where:

-   `/tgtdeleg`Â uses the Kerberos GSS-API to obtain a useable TGT for the user without needing to know their password, NTLM/AES hash, or elevation on the host.
-   `/ticketuser`Â is the username of the principal to impersonate.
-   `/ticketuserid`Â is the domain RID of that principal. Â This can be obtained using a command likeÂ `powershell Get-DomainUser -Identity nlamb -Properties objectsid`.
-   `/groups`Â are the desired group RIDs (512 being Domain Admins).
-   `/krbkey`Â is the krbtgt AES256 hash.

And we can leverage it to access a resource such as the domain controller.
